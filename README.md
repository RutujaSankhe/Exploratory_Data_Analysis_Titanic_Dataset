# Title: Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Titanic_Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is a method used to analyze and summarize datasets. EDA is one of the most important step for any data science project. Here i have done data analysis of Titanic dataset. The titanic dataset is most popular dataset used for data analysis and machine learning. It contains information of all the passengers aboard in the titanic which unfortunately was shipwrecked. This dataset is used to predict whether a given passenger is survived or not. I used Google colab to implement the overall model.
